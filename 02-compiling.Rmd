```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.align = 'center')
```

```{r panelset, echo=FALSE}
xaringanExtra::use_panelset()
```


## What does it mean to "compile" a document?

```{r render, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Rendering (from https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/render.png")
```

Often, when talking about "compiling" RMarkdown documents, you will find different words used for this process, such as "compiling", "rendering", and "knitting".  

The basic idea is that we are turning the **.rmd** file we are editing in RStudio into something much more reader-friendly, such as a **.pdf**, or an **.html**, or even a word file **.docx**. 

```{r echo=F, fig.align="left", out.width="75px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/kniticon.png")
```
If you open up the **.rmd** file from [Lesson 1](01-basics.html), and click the "knit" icon at the top of the document, you see lots of stuff happening below, and then a nicely formatted document will pop-up.

:::rtip
You may find that the document pops up in a separate window, or in the "viewer" pane in the bottom right of RStudio.  
You can control this behaviour by looking in the top menu of RStudio for __"Tools" > "Global Options" > "RMarkdown" > "Show output preview in:"__.

## Compiled Files

- if not saved already, it will ask.
- if saved. then it will go ahead

- the compiled doc (html/pdf) will be in the same folder as where you saved your .rmd file. 
- you can find this in the Files tab of RStudio
- or in a file browser.
- You should now have **TWO** files on your computer with the same name but one is an **.Rmd** and one is a **.html**. You could email the **.html** file to someone and they could open it in their web browser. The **.Rmd** file can only be opened and understood by someone who has access to R. 

## Compiling and Sessions/Environments

- when a document gets knitted, it is a self-contained process.
- everything needs to be in the document

does so in a self-contained enviroment/session - ensures reproducibility

the following video provides an explanation
peppapig <- 4
peppapig * 12
compile = yes

delete peppapig assignment
compile = no

kermit_inthe_console <- 320
environment contains kermit
kermit_inrmd 
compile = no

where is rmd looking for objects, if not the environment? 
its own environment! 



- because of this, there is a typical structure

---
title
author
yaml yaml yaml
---

chunk1 = setup. 
load all required packages
*don't call install.packages here - or it will reinstall the package every time you knit.
load data

chunks2-n = analysis, plots etc,
